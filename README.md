# English-to-French-Language-Translation

A sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model which translates English sentences into their corresponding French sentences.



## Overview

Neural Machine Translation, also referred to as Neural MT, NMT, Deep Neural Machine Translation, Deep NMT, or DNMT, is a cutting-edge machine translation method that uses neural network techniques to estimate the likelihood of a sequence of words. This might be a word or sentence in its entirety, or thanks to recent developments, the entire document. Deep neural networks and artificial intelligence are used in NMT to train neural models, which is a fundamentally different approach to the problem of language translation and localization. In just three years, there has been a significant shift from SMT to NMT, making NMT the main machine translation methodology. With superior fluency and adequacy than statistical machine translation methods, neural machine translation often delivers translations of a significantly higher quality. 

Only a small portion of the memory required by conventional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models is used by neural machine translation. Because the neural translation model is trained end-to-end to maximise translation performance, this NMT approach differs from traditional translation SMT systems. In contrast to the conventional phrase-based translation system, which consists of numerous small sub-components that are tuned separately, neural machine translation aims to create and train a single, massive neural network that can read a sentence and produce an accurate translation.
